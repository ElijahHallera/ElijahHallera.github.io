                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently balancing two exciting roles: as a Senior Lead at Old Navy, where I manage product operations and merchandising, 
                    and as a Teaching Assistant/Tutor at Highline College, assisting students with their understanding of programming fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, and web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to my work, I am in the process of obtaining META certificates in both Front-End and Back-End Development. 
                    These certifications will further strengthen my expertise and enhance my skills in building modern, full-stack applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside my work and studies, I am actively job hunting and preparing for technical interviews to continue progressing in my career in software engineering and development.

            <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
            <div class="RC-content">
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from California State University, Monterey Bay, where I specialized in Software Engineering. 
                    Throughout my academic journey, I gained hands-on experience in software development, web development, and mobile app development. 
                    I’m also passionate about diving deeper into topics like computer architecture and system design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professionally, I’ve had the opportunity to work in an agile, DevOps environment in Monterey Bay, where I developed software solutions for a european client. 
                    I also contributed to a project that involved creating an environmental education website for a government department in Watsonville, California. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of my professional work, I enjoy exploring medical topics, a nod to my earlier studies as an Ex-Biology major, 
                    and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology. When I'm not learning or coding, 
                    you can find me unwinding with music, anime, or gaming with friends.
